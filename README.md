# EVM_Simulations
Those scripts allow you to run simulations on token performances from 1 month to 1 year. You have to download the JSON file and change its location according to where you put it on your computer to run both scripts. The outputs of those scripts are line charts.

Price_comparison.py shows you the crypto-assets price variations for the timeframe you want (1 month to 1 year).

token_index_simulation shows you the price variations of a crypto-asset basket like an index. With this script, you can run portfolio or index simulations. However, the token has to be on DefiLlama API.

The last file named "protocols_contracts" is a data set from DefiLlama that allows linking the symbol of a token to its contract address. Hence, it is possible to find out the price with the DeFiLlama API. This file is a download and can be actualized here: https://defillama.com/docs/api in the section TVL/protocols.
