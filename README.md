# EVM_Simulations
Those scripts allow you to run simulations on token performances from 1 month to 1 year.

Price_comparison.py shows you the crypto-assets price variations for the timeframe you want (1 month to 1 year).

token_index_simulation shows you the price variations of a crypto-asset basket like an index. With this script, you can run portfolio or index simulations. However, the token has to be on DefiLlama API.
